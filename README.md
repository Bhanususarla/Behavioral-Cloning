1. My project includes the following files:
 model.py containing the script to create and train the model
 drive.py for driving the car in autonomous mode
 model.h5 containing a trained convolution neural network
 writeup_report.md or writeup_report.pdf summarizing the result
 video.mp4 - A video recording of the vehicle driving autonomously around the first track.
 video_second-track - A video recording of the vehicle driving autonomously around the second track (partial).
