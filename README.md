# Behavioral-Cloning

In this project, I used deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks to clone driving behavior. I trained, validated and tested a model using Keras. The model outputs a steering angle to an autonomous vehicle.

1. My project includes the following files:
2. model.py containing the script to create and train the model
3. drive.py for driving the car in autonomous mode
4. model.h5 containing a trained convolution neural network
5. writeup_report.md or writeup_report.pdf summarizing the result
6. video.mp4 - A video recording of the vehicle driving autonomously around the first track.
7. video_second-track - A video recording of the vehicle driving autonomously around the second track (partial).

Writeup report pdf has the complete project report
